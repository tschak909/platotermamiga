Loading PLATOTerm
-----------------
Once installed, PLATOTerm can be accessed simply by clicking on its
icon. The icon is a drawing of a Magnavox PLATO IV terminal, from 1974,
and is widely regarded as the iconic PLATO terminal. If you have a
better icon, please contribute!

Using PLATOTerm
---------------
PLATOTerm will then display a splash screen, indicating that it is
ready for use.

Once you see this splash screen, the terminal is ready for use, and you
can send commands to your WIFI modem, to connect to a PLATO service,
such as IRATA.ONLINE:

ATDTIRATA.ONLINE:8005

or, CYBER1.ORG

ATDTCYBERSERV.ORG:8005

For this initial testing release, the baud rate is set in Preferences.
Be sure to set your baud rate and receive buffer size large enough
(at least 4000 bytes). The menu items for setting these parameters
are still being worked on, and are currently not functional.
